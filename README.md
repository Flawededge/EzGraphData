# EzGraphData
This is my first python gui based project

It will "eventually" be able to plot any time based data it's given (assuming that the .csv headers are set correctly)

To do:
	→ Make the gui in the first place
	→ Make it plot a set bit of data
	→ Give a way to run a function to process each column differently
	→ Make the gui user friendly

	And after that's done
	→ Sit back in awe at my first git project
