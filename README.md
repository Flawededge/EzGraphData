# EzGraphData
This is my first python gui based project

It will "eventually" be able to plot any time based data it's given (assuming that the .csv headers are set correctly)

To do: (will be expanded as I go)

~~0.0 → Make the gui in the first place~~ \
**0.1 → Make a plot window and make it do the things**\
0.2 → Make it plot a set bit of data\
0.3 → Give a way to run a function to process each column differently\
0.4 → Make the gui user friendly\

And after that's done:

	1.0 → Sit back in awe at my first git project

I'm using PyCharm (whatever the latest is) with python 3.7

To grab all of the dependencies, run:

    pip3 install -r dependencies.txt
