# EzGraphData - Readme
- Intro
    -
This is my first python gui based project, and first project being put on Git. Woo!

The purpose of me making this is for my current job, I need to plot large data sets, 
be able to read them and then get some useful information out of them

The project is being done in python due to the ease of coding and NumPy, 
which is really good at loading large data sets and then doing vectorized calculations fast

- Quick start guide
    - 

I'm using PyCharm with python 3.7 https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Once you're in the python interpreter
All of the dependencies can be grabbed with:

    pip3 install -r dependencies.txt

Then run main.py

And that's it!
